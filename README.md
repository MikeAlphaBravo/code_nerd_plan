##### The overall theme here is code more.  Code often.  Code well.  I know this will be my greatest challenge as I enjoy and am good at a lot of the other things.  So I will ask when I need help, look until I cannot look any longer and persevere.  I offer a lot as an employee but I am still a very weak coder.  
##### I need to work on developing good coding habits to be productive with my time while not getting so lost that the time is wasted.  I have developed better habits coding all day every day and hope to utilize those skills and not get lazy.  
##### I need to set aside specific time in my real life once I am back at a normal job or it will not happen.  
##### I also really need to get everything I can out of this internship opportunity and come away with it ahead of where I went into it.  My goal and hope with all of that is to work more in depth on one or two things rather than jumping from topic to topic.

Thank you Franz for all the guidance.  You are irreplaceable in your kind and wise words.
